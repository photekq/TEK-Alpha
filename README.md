TEK-Alpha keyboard case.

Designed as a dampened (gasket) mount keyboard in 2015. Project was ditched due to me quitting the hobby temporarily.

Files are intended to be used for renders, but you can use them for whatever you want - no limits. Please credit me for the case design if you post any renders online.
